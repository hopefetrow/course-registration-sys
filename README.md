A java program for course registration 

<h2> Purpose </h2>
Assignment for CS 1120 - Computer Science II

<h2> Problem </h2>
<p><strong>Develop a Java application to implement this Course Registration System:</strong></p>
<p>University of Parkview provides inexpensive education to students. The tuition rates are very low. This causes a problem in that the university doesn't have the money to hire enough faculty members to offer enough courses for students. Popular classes run out of space very soon after the course registration system is open.</p>
<p>The following rules have been made to decide which students have priority in registering for specific classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students who are majors in the department that offers a class have priority to register this class over students from other departments. </li>
<li>After that, the student who is closer to graduation has priority to register for the class. For example, seniors have priority over juniors; sophomores have priority over freshmen, etc. </li>
<li>If the priority cannot be decided by applying the above rules, the “first come, first served” rule will be applied to decide who has priority to register for the class. </li>
</ul>
